# Sales-Overview-Dashboard-using-PowerBi
•	Designing a dynamic Power BI dashboard that tracks key metrics—Sales, Profit, and Quantity—across four regions: Central, East, South, and West. 

•	The dashboard should allow users to filter by year and dynamically switch between the three metrics (Sales, Profit, and Quantity). 

•	The dashboard includes a comparison with the previous year's (PY) sales for the selected year.
